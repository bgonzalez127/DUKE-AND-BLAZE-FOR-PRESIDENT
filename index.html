            <p>A lot of people would be skeptical about dogs becoming president however MAYOR STUBBS a mayor in ALASKA was mayor of Talkeetna, Alaska from July 1997 until his death.(Rest in Peace great one) He did a wonderful job taking care of his town. We can also see TAMA a female calico cat who gained fame for being a station master and operating officer at Kishi Station on the Kishigawa Line in Kinokawa, Wakayama Prefecture, Japan; Bosco the dog is another great example of a dog elected honorary mayor of the unincorporated community of Sunol, California, United States; Catmando was a cat who served as joint leader of Britain's Official Monster Raving Loony Party (OMRLP), he is the only cat ever to have been named leader of a political party.(TALK ABLOUT ICONIC); Sergeant Stubby was a dog who is the official mascot of the 102nd Infantry Regiment (United States) and was assigned to the 26th (Yankee) Division in World War I. He served for 18 months and participated in seventeen battles on the Western Front. He saved his regiment from surprise mustard gas attacks, found and comforted the wounded, and once caught a German soldier by the seat of his pants, holding him there until American soldiers found him.(We stan army veterans in this household) AND FINALLY Wojtek as a Syrian brown bear bought, as a young cub, at a railway station in Hamadan, Iran, by Polish II Corps soldiers who had been evacuated from the Soviet Union. In order to provide for his rations and transportation, he was eventually enlisted officially as a soldier with the rank of private, and was subsequently promoted to corporal.</p>
